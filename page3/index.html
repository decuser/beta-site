            Installing and running Fossil on TrueNAS Core
          </a>
        </h3><p>This note is about installing and running Fossil SCM on TrueNAS Core.</p>

<p>Fossil is brought to us by the same people who developed SQLite. It was created to serve their needs, but is useful to everybody with a similar set of needs (pretty much any dev team). According to the fossil folks over at <a href="https://fossil-scm.org">https://fossil-scm.org</a>, “Fossil is a simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration management system…” To mme, it’s my git-killer.</p>

<p>I have been running Fossil for about a year to see if it was worth replacing git for my own use. After this year, while I still like git and I will continue to use it for disposable repos, I have completely jumped ship for my own repos and won’t be going back to hosting them on anything else anytime soon. Fossil is very lightweight, fast and responsive, has a fantastic server side ui, and is slightly more intuitive to use. It is also easier to recover from when things go wonky.</p>

            Sculpt 22.10 - A Truly Alternative OS
          </a>
        </h3><p>This note is about installing and running Sculpt OS 22.10 in VirtualBox.</p>

<p>SculptOS is an operating system built out of components provided by the Genode Operating System Framework and as such it qualifies as a truly alternative operating system. These days, that’s quite a feat. Most ‘alternatives’ are linux distros or flavors. This OS runs on a microkernel - Nova or any one of several other choices. It is decidedly not unix, windows, linux, haiku, beos, os/2 or any other mainstream os.</p>

<p>Sculpt OS is made so that it is relatively straightforward, if not easy, to provide a secure computing environment where applications and services are built on a Trusted Computing Base… that is an application is provisioned explicitly to depend on a tree of components that are known to be trustworthy, and are sandboxed. It is similar in some ways to Qubes OS, but significantly different in others.</p>

<p>The learning curve is steep. So, as I explore the environment and learn more about it, I’ll post more of these notes.</p>

<p>Here’s the OS running stuff.</p>

            Building Sculpt 22.10 on Debian 11.6 Bullseye without a Desktop
          </a>
        </h3><p>Sheesh, live and learn. I didn’t pay any attention to system requirements in the prior note <a href="/operating-systems/genode/sculpt/2022/12/29/building-sculpt-22.10-on-debian-11.6.html">Building Sculpt 22.10 on Debian 11.6 Bullseye</a>. I just glibly provisioned using a small portion of my available resources. In this note, I’ve corrected this oversight. The system requirements are much, much more modest than what I originally provisioned. There is no need for the overkill.</p>

<p>This note is about building a bootable Sculpt OS 22.10 image using a Debian 11 “Bullseye” Guest OS running in VirtualBox without a desktop. If you were to include the desktop, expect that the system requirements would increase, but not by lot. I expect it would work with these same provisions, but would work better with more CPUs and RAM, as well as with a bigger allocation of hard disk space.</p>

<p>Bottom line - The image can be built comfortably, in a reasonable amount of time (call it 15 minutes to download the toolchain, and source code, and do the build), on a system with 512 MB RAM, 1 CPU, 12 GB HDD, but it’s faster with more resources provisioned, where CPU seems to be the biggest factor - more is better letting us use parallel threads in make.</p>

        </h3><p>This note is about building a bootable Sculpt OS 22.10 image using a Debian 11 “Bullseye” Guest OS running in VirtualBox. This is useful as a starting point for building a custom image. My Thinkpad T430 runs Sculpt just fine, but wifi doesn’t work, so I would like to add the needed firmware. This is work in that direction.</p>

<p>The note also applies, leaving out the VirtualBox specifics, to building Sculpt OS 22.10 on a Debian instance running on metal (confirmed working 12/28).</p>

<p>Without TUHS, it would hardly even be possible to enjoy retro unix explorations. This is a well earned accolade by an unassuming and very hard working individual.</p>
